# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. The `bootstrap.sh` script is from here: https://github.com/kevinrenskers/dotfiles

## Usage
Simply run `./bootstrap.sh` from this checkout whenever you have made changes to files in this checkout.

## OSX settings
To use the initial setup script for OSX run `. .osx`. This only needs to be run once, but if you make changes to it then you can run it again.

## Karabiner
There is a lot of [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) settings and modifications in the config folder. I like to have the same keyboard layout on my native Macbook keyboard and on my Anne Pro and Vortex Pok3r. I don't really use the programming layers on the keyboards, I just have everything in Karabiner.

## Prompt
I use Oh my zsh and it works great for me. I've tried to switch to others, but it just works too well.
