# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. The `bootstrap.sh` script is from here: https://github.com/kevinrenskers/dotfiles

## Usage
Simply run `./bootstrap.sh` from this checkout whenever you have made changes to files in this checkout.

## OSX settings
To use the initial setup script for OSX run `. .osx`. This only needs to be run once, but if you make changes to it then you can run it again.

## Prompt
I use [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt) to get a prompt that is git aware. I like the default theme.
